=== Metrics Overview

==== Problem Statement

* Compare Eclipse Collections and JDK Collections
** Performance
** Memory
** Ease of Writing Code

* Measure using a relatable scenario - *Reconciler*
** Requires 2 datasets
** Needs to perform computations for comparison

* Specifications:
** Timing measured as a median over 50 iterations
** Memory measured as the max heap size found on Visual VM
** Lower the numbers the better
** Your mileage may vary

* Eclipse Collections Data Structures: Under the Hood
